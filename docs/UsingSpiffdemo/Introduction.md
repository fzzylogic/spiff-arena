# Introduction

## Overview of SpiffArena

SpiffArena is a comprehensive, web-based application designed to manage workflows. It integrates multiple tools into a single platform, providing a turnkey solution for workflow management. 

SpiffArena is built around the SpiffWorkflow library, which is responsible for all the BPMN processing. SpiffArena serves as a wrapper around the library, making it more accessible to a larger audience and solving many common problems that people face when running processes.

The SpiffWorkflow library provides a Python API for managing processes with minimal dependencies. Its primary purpose is to allow workflow execution and workflow serialization/deserialization. It can run a workflow and execute all "engine" tasks, and it knows how to save the state of a workflow to JSON and how to resurrect that workflow from JSON back to an executable state.

## Purpose vs Applications

The purpose of SpiffArena is to streamline the management of workflows, combining many tools into one application. In terms of applications, SpiffWorkflow can be used by Python developers who want to create custom workflow systems or embed BPMN features into existing applications. It can be used to pull information from one system and use it in another, reducing the need for manual intervention. It also allows for the automation of tasks, freeing up time for more important work.
